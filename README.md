# SKY-SPORTS-World-Cup-Analysis
This project focuses on performing in-depth SQL-based analysis on comprehensive team statistics from a major international football tournament (likely the 2022 World Cup group stages and subsequent matches), inspired by data featured on Sky Sports' Football Digest.

The data provides a rich set of traditional and advanced metrics, including expected goals (xG), possession, goalkeeping performance, and shot/goal creation actions, offering a complete picture of each team's performance.
